so i think specifically plan for 
- using pyqt5 for computer vision output

think about the multi-threading
- this might take a few tries to nail but will be worth it

do things programmatically not dynamically
- doesnt mean we can use things like check page and wait 
- but just do like, take action, confirm result, take action, confirm result

tbf with that in mind for the very first version just to get out functionality
maybe multi-threading is best left for now
idk yet lets see anyways
